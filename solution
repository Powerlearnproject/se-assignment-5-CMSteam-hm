Answer 1
To download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on Windows 11, follow these steps:
Prerequisites
1. Administrator Access: Ensure you have administrator rights on your Windows 11 machine
to install software.
2. .NET Framework: While VS Code itself does not require the .NET Framework, some
extensions might. It’s generally a good idea to ensure that you have the latest version of the
.NET Framework installed. You can check this through Windows Update or by downloading it
directly from the [Microsoft
website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).
Steps to Download and Install Visual Studio Code
1. Open Your Web Browser:
- Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Edge, Chrome, Firefox).
2. Go to the Visual Studio Code Website:
- Navigate to the official Visual Studio Code download page:
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Download Visual Studio Code:
- On the homepage, you’ll see a prominent download button that automatically detects
your operating system.
- Click the “Download for Windows” button. This will download the VS Code installer (`.exe`
file).
4. Run the Installer:
- Locate the downloaded `VSCodeSetup.exe` file (usually in your Downloads folder) and
double-click it to start the installation.
5. Installation Setup:
- A setup wizard will open. Follow these steps in the wizard:
- Step 1: Read and accept the license agreement, then click “Next”.
- Step 2: Choose the installation location or leave it as default, then click “Next”.
- Step 3: Select additional tasks:
- Add "Open with Code" action to the Windows Explorer file context menu
(recommended).
- Add "Open with Code" action to the Windows Explorer directory context menu
(recommended).
- Register Code as an editor for supported file types (recommended).
- Add to PATH (this allows you to open VS Code from the command line).
- Click “Next”, then “Install” to begin the installation.
6. Complete Installation:
- Once the installation is complete, you can choose to launch Visual Studio Code
immediately by checking the appropriate box and clicking “Finish”.
First-time Setup
1. Launch Visual Studio Code:
- If you didn’t choose to launch VS Code at the end of the installation, you can open it from
the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
2. Configure Settings and Extensions:
- Welcome Page: On first launch, VS Code will show a Welcome page with useful tips and
shortcuts.
- Theme and Interface: Customize your theme and interface settings from the settings icon
in the lower left corner or by pressing `Ctrl + ,` (comma).
- Install Extensions: Enhance functionality by installing extensions. Click on the Extensions
icon on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`) and search for extensions you need (e.g.,
Python, C#, JavaScript).
3. Set Up Your Workspace:
- Open a folder or create a new file to start coding.
- Customize your workspace settings and layout as needed.
Additional Configuration (Optional)
- Version Control Integration: If you use Git, you can integrate it with VS Code. Ensure Git is
installed on your system and then configure it in the VS Code settings.
- Settings Sync: If you use VS Code on multiple devices, you can enable Settings Sync to
synchronize your settings, extensions, and configurations across devices.

Question 9
How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of
initialising a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Submission Guidelines:
Answer 9
Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control
1. Setting Up Git
- Install Git: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- Configure Git: Open a terminal and run the following commands to set up your Git
username and email:
```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
2. Initializing a Repository
1. Open Your Project Folder in VS Code:
- Go to `File > Open Folder` and select your project folder.
2. Initialize Git Repository:
- Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or by
pressing `Ctrl + Shift + G`.
- Click "Initialize Repository" in the Source Control view. This creates a `.git` directory in
your project folder, which stores the version control data.
3. Create a `.gitignore` File:
- Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project folder to specify which files and
directories to ignore.
- Example content for a Node.js project:
```
node_modules/
.env
```
3. Making Commits
1. Staging Changes:
- In the Source Control view, you will see a list of changes. Click the "+" icon next to each

Submission Guidelines
When submitting code or changes to a repository, follow these guidelines:
1. Write Clear Commit Messages:
- Use concise, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes. For
example:
```
Add user authentication
```
2. Commit Frequently:
- Make small, incremental commits frequently to ensure changes are easy to track and
manage.
3. Use Branches:
- For new features or bug fixes, create a new branch. This keeps the `master` or `main`
branch stable and clean.
- Example:
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature
```
4. Pull Requests:
- When ready to merge changes into the main branch, create a pull request on GitHub.
This allows for code review and discussion before merging.
5. Follow Project Conventions:
- Adhere to any specific conventions or guidelines set by the project, such as code style,
commit message format, and branch naming.
